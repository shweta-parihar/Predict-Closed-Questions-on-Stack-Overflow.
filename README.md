# Predict closed questions on Stack Overflow - Kaggle competition project

Stack Overflow is a website where millions of programmers get high quality answers to their programming questions every day. With more than six thousand new questions asked every weekday, not all questions remain open on the website. About 6% of all new questions end up "closed". Questions can be closed as 'off topic', 'not constructive', 'not a real question', or 'too localized'.

Our task is to predict which questions will be closed and why. This becomes a multi-class classification model. Here, I have integrated a pretrained BERT 'bert-base-uncased' in our model along with dropout and early stopping. The goal is to create a sophisticated software solutions to the moderation toolbox so that questions can be classified without human intervention.
